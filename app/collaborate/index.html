      <h2>About us</h2>
      <div class="slice-body">
        <p>
	  The Library Innovation Lab is a team of librarians,
	  programmers, artists, and lawyers with a broad mission: to
	  build open source tools and services, open to everyone and
	  in the public interest, solving serious emerging problems
	  from the unique perspective of the world's largest academic
	  law library. We are seeking web developers to join our team.
        </p>

        <p>
	  Our tech team at full strength includes five developers and
	  a devops engineer, working most often with Django, Vue, and
	  Postgres.

      <h2>About you</h2>
      <div class="slice-body">
        <p>
	  While we encourage anyone to apply, this is a particularly
	  good fit for experienced developers who want to spend some
	  time working in the public interest in an academic setting,
	  with room to pursue their own priorities relating to our
	  mission.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="slice">
      <h2>What we offer</h2>
      <div class="slice-body">
	<p>
	  Work on stuff that matters. Our core projects are about
	  opening access to law; redefining legal casebooks and
	  reducing their cost; and exploring cutting-edge web archival
	  techniques to keep important links working for the next 100
	  years.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Build open source. All of our projects are open source and
	  otherwise designed to maximize the public benefit of our
	  work.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Set your own pace. We are a small, self-directed group. Pick
	  the priorities where you see the highest impact at a pace
	  that feels comfortable. We have real vacations and no crunch
	  time.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Set your own research agenda. We are located at
	  the <a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/library/">Harvard Law
	  School Library</a> and share a kitchen with
	  the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein
	  Center</a>
	  and <a href="https://metalabharvard.github.io/">metaLAB</a>. Going
	  to events, having conversations, developing your scholarly
	  perspective, and exploring it through code are
	  encouraged. We will specifically prioritize these things at
	  the cost of shipping the next feature.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Have job stability and support. While we maintain the creative 
	  atmosphere and flexibility of a small innovation lab, we're 
	  backed by an established institution with strong benefits and 
	  support for employees.

      <h2>Location</h2>
      <div class="slice-body">
	<p>
	  We are based in a newly renovated space on the Harvard Law
	  School campus. While you can set your own schedule for home
	  and on-site days, the ideal candidate will benefit from
	  regular on-site collaboration with our team and the Harvard
	  community.

      <h2>Diversity</h2>
      <div class="slice-body">
        <p>
          The work and well-being of the Lab are strengthened profoundly by the
          diversity of our network and our differences in background, culture,
          experience, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, and much
          more. We actively seek and welcome applications from people of color,
          women, the LGBTQ+ community, and persons with disabilities, as well as
          applications from researchers and practitioners from across the
          spectrum of disciplines and methods.
