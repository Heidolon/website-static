          LIL is a hallway connecting three rooms of party guests - law folks,
          tech folks, and library folks. It's a fantastic group of people and we
          want you to join us!
        </p>

        <p>
          We invite you to collaborate with us anytime by dropping us an

        <p>
          We're currently accepting applications for a Program Coordinator who
          will help keep us organized, efficient and responsive to the needs of
          our communities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our three major projects -
          <a href="https://case.law">the Caselaw Access Project</a>,
          <a href="https://perma.cc">Perma.cc</a> and
          <a href="https://opencasebook.org">H2O</a> all have grown
          significantly in adoption and complexity in recent years. We're
          looking to add a new LIL team member who can coordinate all of the
          essential and recurring activities that make those projects
          successful, as well as the administrative operations that keep LIL
          running smoothly.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a Program Coordinator, you'll help us expand the impact of our work
          to meet the needs of growing communities of scholars, students,
          teachers, lawyers, librarians, judges, journalists and beyond. You'll
          also lead our continuous efforts to streamline and improve
          administrative process and to build productive relationships with our
          colleagues across Harvard.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ideal Program Coordinator will be curious, organized,
          self-motivated and eager to help us refine the operational activities
          of the Lab. We welcome candidates with backgrounds in law, technology
          or librarianship, but expertise in those areas is not required.

      <h2>Diversity</h2>
      <div class="slice-body">
        <p>
          The work and well-being of the Lab are strengthened profoundly by the
          diversity of our network and our differences in background, culture,
          experience, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, and much
          more. We actively seek and welcome applications from people of color,
          women, the LGBTQ+ community, and persons with disabilities, as well as
          applications from researchers and practitioners from across the
          spectrum of disciplines and methods.
