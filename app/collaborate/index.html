			<h2>About us</h2>
			<div class="slice-body">
				<p>
					The Library Innovation Lab is a team of librarians,
					programmers, artists, and lawyers with a broad mission: to
					build open source tools and services, open to everyone and
					in the public interest, solving serious emerging problems
					from the unique perspective of the world's largest academic
					law library. On the tech side we work most often with Django,
					Vue, and Postgres.

				<p>
					While we encourage anyone to apply, our Web Developer roles are a particularly
					good fit for experienced developers who want to spend some
					time working in the public interest in an academic setting,
					with room to pursue their own priorities relating to our
					mission.
				</p>

				<h3>What we offer</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Work on stuff that matters. Our core projects are about
						opening access to law; redefining legal casebooks and
						reducing their cost; and exploring cutting-edge web archival
						techniques to keep important links working for the next 100
						years.
					</li>
					<li>
						Build open source. All of our projects are open source and
						otherwise designed to maximize the public benefit of our
						work.
					</li>
					<li>
						Set your own pace. We are a small, self-directed group. Pick
						the priorities where you see the highest impact at a pace
						that feels comfortable. We have real vacations and no crunch
						time.
					</li>
					<li>
						Set your own research agenda. We are located at
						the <a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/library/">Harvard Law
						School Library</a> and share a kitchen with
						the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein
						Center</a>
						and <a href="https://metalabharvard.github.io/">metaLAB</a>. Going
						to events, having conversations, developing your scholarly
						perspective, and exploring it through code are
						encouraged. We will specifically prioritize these things at
						the cost of shipping the next feature.
					</li>
					<li>
						Have job stability and support. While we maintain the creative
						atmosphere and flexibility of a small innovation lab, we're
						backed by an established institution with strong benefits and
						support for employees.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Location</h3>
				<p>
					We are based in a newly renovated space on the Harvard Law
					School campus. While you can set your own schedule for home
					and on-site days, the ideal candidate will benefit from
					regular on-site collaboration with our team and the Harvard
					community.
