      <h2>Summer Research Assistants</h2>
      <div class="slice-body">
        <p>We're currently accepting applications for remote summer research assistants.</p>
        <p>We work at the intersection of libraries, technology, and the law, building and supporting
        projects that broaden access to information through open source software. This summer, we're seeking research assistants to participate broadly in the life and work of LIL and to focus, in particular, on exploring new territory in connection with our <a href="https://opencasebook.org">H2O Open Casebook</a> project, an open education platform built to create better teaching materials while reducing the cost of education for students.</p>
        <p>As a research assistant, you'll help us imagine and act on new ways to serve the growing community of faculty, librarians and students who are interested in open educational resources in the legal field. You'll also get involved in the work of our team of librarians, lawyers and programmers on other projects such as the <a href="https://case.law">Caselaw Access Project</a> and <a href="https://perma.cc">Perma.cc</a>.</p>
        <p>The ideal research assistant will be curious, self-motivated and eager to interact directly with our team and the communities we serve. We welcome applications from current and future law students, as well as those with technical expertise, but neither legal nor technical expertise is required.</p>

        <h2>Diversity</h2>
        <div class="slice-body">
            <p>The work and well-being of the Lab are strengthened profoundly by the diversity of our network and our
                differences in background, culture, experience, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, and much
                more.
                We actively seek and welcome applications from people of color, women, the LGBTQ+ community, and persons
                with
                disabilities, as well as applications from researchers and practitioners from across the spectrum of
                disciplines
                and methods.</p>
