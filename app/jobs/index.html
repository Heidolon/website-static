				<p>
					The Library Innovation Lab is a team of librarians,
					programmers, artists, and lawyers with a broad mission: to
					build open source tools and services, open to everyone and
					in the public interest, solving serious emerging problems
					from the unique perspective of the world's largest academic
					law library. On the tech side we work most often with Django,
					Vue, and Postgres.

					The work and well-being of the Lab are strengthened profoundly by the
					diversity of our network and our differences in background, culture,
					experience, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, and much
					more. We actively seek and welcome applications from people of color,
					women, the LGBTQ+ community, and persons with disabilities, as well as
					applications from researchers and practitioners from across the
					spectrum of disciplines and methods.
