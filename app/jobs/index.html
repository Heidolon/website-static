			<h2>About us</h2>
			<div class="slice-body">
				<p>
					The Library Innovation Lab is a team of librarians,
					programmers, artists, and lawyers with a broad mission: to
					build open source tools and services, open to everyone and
					in the public interest, solving serious emerging problems
					from the unique perspective of the world's largest academic
					law library. On the tech side we work most often with Django,
					Vue, and Postgres.

			<h2 id="web-developer">Web Developer</h2>
			<div class="slice-body">
				<p>
					While we encourage anyone to apply, our Web Developer roles are a particularly
					good fit for experienced developers who want to spend some
					time working in the public interest in an academic setting,
					with room to pursue their own priorities relating to our
					mission.
				</p>

				<h3>What we offer</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Work on stuff that matters. Our core projects are about
						opening access to law; redefining legal casebooks and
						reducing their cost; and exploring cutting-edge web archival
						techniques to keep important links working for the next 100
						years.
					</li>
					<li>
						Build open source. All of our projects are open source and
						otherwise designed to maximize the public benefit of our
						work.
					</li>
					<li>
						Set your own pace. We are a small, self-directed group. Pick
						the priorities where you see the highest impact at a pace
						that feels comfortable. We have real vacations and no crunch
						time.
					</li>
					<li>
						Set your own research agenda. We are located at
						the <a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/library/">Harvard Law
						School Library</a> and share a kitchen with
						the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein
						Center</a>
						and <a href="https://mlml.io/">metaLAB</a>. Going
						to events, having conversations, developing your scholarly
						perspective, and exploring it through code are
						encouraged. We will specifically prioritize these things at
						the cost of shipping the next feature.
					</li>
					<li>
						Have job stability and support. While we maintain the creative
						atmosphere and flexibility of a small innovation lab, we're
						backed by an established institution with strong benefits and
						support for employees.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Location</h3>
				<p>
					We are based in a newly renovated space on the Harvard Law
					School campus. While you can set your own schedule for home
					and on-site days, the ideal candidate will benefit from
					regular on-site collaboration with our team and the Harvard
					community.

			<h2 id="summer-ra">Summer 2022 Research Assistants</h2>
			<div class="slice-body">

				<p>We're seeking incoming first-year law students with a background in technology or design to join the Library Innovation Lab as summer research assistants. </p>

				<p>We work at the intersection of libraries, technology, and the law, building and supporting projects that broaden access to information through open source software. This summer, we're seeking research assistants to participate broadly in the life and work of LIL, and to help our team advance our development goals in the fields of open access data and learning.</p>

				<p>As a research assistant, you will have the opportunity to jump into legal academia via a technical lens, rooting yourself in a law library focused both on innovation and legal tradition. You will help us imagine and act on new ways to serve the growing community of faculty, librarians and students who are interested in our three tent-pole projects: <a href="https://opencasebook.org">H2O Open Casebook</a>, <a href="https://case.law">The Caselaw Access Project</a> and <a href="https://perma.cc">Perma.cc</a>.</p>

				<p>Our team will work with each research assistant to scope out a development roadmap that builds upon our current project goals and highlights the candidate's interests. We're looking for a collaborator, not an intern.</p>

				<p>The ideal research assistant will be an incoming law student with a technical background who is curious, self-motivated and eager to interact directly with our team and the broader law school community. While neither legal nor specific technical expertise is required, we are seeking candidates who would feel comfortable developing alongside a team who works mainly with Django and Vue.</p>

				<p>To take a look at our code and get a sense of work, please visit <a href="https://github.com/harvard-lil">https://github.com/harvard-lil</a>. <strong>Applications are due Friday, April 15th and start dates will be scheduled for early June 2022</strong>.</p>

				<p><a href="https://harvard.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_4O8yUcYUmSDTNki">Please apply here</a>.</p>
